# Project-1

This web application is called Liftify. The main functionality is searching exercises by muscle and tracking nutrition via food item. Two api's control that functionality. Using javascript, an api fetch call function with an api key was used. Following that, ".then" was used to take the values from the call and turn it into a ".json". Using this information, javascript functions controlled the next steps in the functionality of the application. This includes a function to show exercises, add exercises and navigate to the workout tracker page. All of this is possible by using local storage. To track the added workouts, local storage alowed for collecting the inputs and logging them so the second page could access it. For the nutrition tracker, no local storage was needed. This api was not used for extensive functionality. Only a simple, surface level nutrition tracker that gives information on the food item. As for the html files, Bulma CSS was used to style them. "Hero", "Box" and "Columns", were the most used Bulma elements used in the html. These elements made the styling look more modern and adhear to flexbox. It is a responsive design that displays responsively on different screen sizes.
